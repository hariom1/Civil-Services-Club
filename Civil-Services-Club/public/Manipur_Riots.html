                    <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 2022 Bali G20 Summit in Indonesia. As India has taken the responsibility to preside over G20, letâ€™s have a deeper look into it. 
                        <br /-->
                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>The state of Manipur in Northeast India has recently experienced a wave of violence and unrest,
                        stemming from a series of events and underlying tensions. This report aims to provide an
                        in-depth analysis of the causes and implications of the ongoing turmoil in Manipur. By examining
                        the triggering factors, historical context, and demographic dynamics, we can gain a
                        comprehensive understanding of the root causes of the unrest. Additionally, we will explore the
                        immediate consequences and the potential implications for the future of the state.<br><br>
                    </p>


                    <h2>The Violence and its Origins:</h2>
                    The violence in Manipur began on May 3, triggered by a solidarity march organized by the All Tribal
                    Students Union Manipur (ATSUM) in opposition to a Manipur High Court order. The court had directed
                    the state government to recommend the inclusion of the Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribes
                    (STs) list. This decision ignited tensions between different ethnic communities and set the stage
                    for the violent clashes that followed.<br><br>



                    <h2>Government Intervention:</h2>
                    <p> In response to the escalating violence, the Central government invoked Article 355 of the
                        Constitution, which empowers the Centre to take necessary measures to protect a state against
                        internal disturbances. Consequently, security forces from the Army, Assam Rifles, Rapid Action
                        Force, and local police were deployed to maintain law and order in the affected areas.
                        <br><br>

                        Let's rewind a bit and look at why it happened:<br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Merger of Manipur with the Union of India:<br>
                            - Manipur was a princely state under British colonial rule before 1947. The Maharaja of
                            Manipur, Bodhachandra Singh, was the ruler of the state.<br>
                            - In August 1947, India gained independence from British colonial rule, and the British
                            withdrew from India. The princely states were given the choice to join either India or
                            Pakistan or remain independent.<br>
                            - The Maharaja of Manipur signed the Instrument of Accession in August 1947, agreeing to
                            accede to the Indian Union.<br>
                            - In June 1948, Manipur held an election based on universal adult franchise, establishing a
                            constitutional monarchy.<br>
                            - In September 1949, under pressure from the Government of India, the Maharaja of Manipur
                            signed the Merger Agreement, effectively merging Manipur with the Indian Union.<br>
                            - On January 21, 1972, Manipur, along with Meghalaya and Tripura, became a full-fledged
                            state under the North Eastern Region (Reorganisation) Act, 1971.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> Ethnicity of Manipur:<br>
                            - The Meiteis are the largest community in Manipur, found predominantly in the Imphal
                            plains. They can also be found in the states of Assam, Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, and
                            Mizoram. Some of them reside in Myanmar and Bangladesh.<br>
                            - The Meiteis predominantly identify as Hindu, while about 8% of them are Muslim.<br>
                            - They speak the Meitei language, officially known as Manipuri, which belongs to the
                            Tibeto-Burman language family.<br>
                            - The Meitei community has a rich cultural heritage, with traditional calendars, dance forms
                            like Manipuri dance, martial art forms like Tang-ta, and sports like Sagol Kangjei (Polo)
                            and Mukna Kangjei (traditional wrestling).<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> Meitei's Demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) Status:<br>
                            - The Meitei Tribe Union recently approached the Manipur High Court, seeking directions to
                            the Manipur government to recommend the inclusion of the Meitei community in the ST list of
                            Manipur to the Union Ministry for Tribal Affairs.<br>
                            - The petitioners argued that the Meitei community was recognized as a tribe before the
                            merger of Manipur with the Union of India in 1949. They claimed that the community lost its
                            identity as a tribe after the merger and seeks to regain it through ST status.<br>
                            - The demand for ST status is driven by the need to preserve the community's culture,
                            ancestral land, tradition, and language. The Meiteis believe that ST status would provide
                            constitutional safeguards to protect their heritage.<br>
                            - The Scheduled Tribes Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) has been advocating for the
                            inclusion of the Meiteis in the ST list since 2012, highlighting the lack of constitutional
                            safeguards for the community. <br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Population Decline and Marginalization:<br>
                            - The Meitei community claims that they have been gradually marginalized in their ancestral
                            land, leading to a decline in their population.<br>
                            - According to the 2011 Census data, the Meiteis constituted 44% of the total population of
                            Manipur, compared to 59% in 1951.<br>
                            - The decline in population is seen as a threat to the community's cultural identity and
                            their position in Manipuri society.<br>
                            - Meitei community members filed contempt proceedings against the Hill Areas Committee (HAC)
                            of the Manipur Assembly, which passed a resolution opposing their inclusion under the ST
                            category.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Demographic Changes and Marginalization of the Meiteis:<br><br>

                            A. Population Decline:<br>
                            1. According to census data, the population of the Meiteis, who predominantly reside in the
                            Manipur Valley, has witnessed a decline over the years.<br>
                            2. In 1951, the Meitei population constituted approximately 59% of the total population of
                            Manipur.<br>
                            3. However, as per the 2011 Census data, the Meitei population has decreased to around 44%
                            of the total population.<br>
                            4. This decline has raised concerns among the Meiteis about the preservation of their
                            cultural identity and the need for protective measures.<br><br>

                            B. Marginalization and Ancestral Land:<br>
                            1. The Meiteis claim to have been gradually marginalized in their ancestral land due to
                            various factors, including demographic changes and encroachment.<br>
                            2. They argue that the influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar has put
                            pressure on their land and resources, leading to a dilution of their cultural heritage and
                            economic opportunities.<br>
                            3. The Meiteis believe that the inclusion of their community in the Scheduled Tribe (ST)
                            list would provide constitutional safeguards and help protect their land, tradition,
                            culture, and language.<br><br>

                            C. Need for Protective Measures:<br>
                            1. The demand for ST status by the Meiteis stems from the aspiration to preserve their
                            distinct identity and address the challenges they perceive in their own state.<br>
                            2. They argue that inclusion in the ST list would provide them with legal protection, access
                            to reservations in education and employment, and a platform to safeguard their cultural
                            practices.<br>
                            3. The Meiteis believe that ST status would enable them to assert their rights and prevent
                            further marginalization in their own ancestral land.<br><br>

                            D. Opposition and Controversies:<br>
                            1. The demand for ST status by the Meiteis has faced opposition from various quarters,
                            including other ethnic groups in Manipur.<br>
                            2. Hill tribes, such as the Naga and Kuki communities, have expressed concerns about
                            potential shifts in political and economic power if the Meiteis were granted ST status.<br>
                            3. Some argue that the existing affirmative action policies for the Meiteis, such as
                            reservations based on caste and backwardness, are sufficient and that the ST status could
                            lead to further inequalities and conflicts.<br>
                            4. The issue remains a subject of debate and negotiation, highlighting the complexities of
                            addressing the aspirations and grievances of different ethnic communities in
                            Manipur.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Demographic Changes and Land Ownership:<br>
                            A. Hill People's Population Increase and Religious Affiliation:<br>
                            1. The hill tribes of Manipur, including the Naga and Kuki communities, have witnessed a
                            significant increase in their population over the years, according to available census
                            data.<br>
                            2. This population growth can be attributed to factors such as higher birth rates, improved
                            healthcare facilities, and increased life expectancy among the hill tribes.<br>
                            3. Additionally, the majority of the hill tribes have embraced Christianity as their primary
                            religion, which has become prevalent among these communities.<br><br>

                            B. Disparities in Land Ownership:<br>
                            1. Land ownership in Manipur has been characterized by disparities between the valley and
                            the hills.<br>
                            2. The hill tribes generally have the ability to purchase land in the valley regions,
                            whereas the Meiteis face restrictions on buying land in the hills.<br>
                            3. This discrepancy in land ownership has contributed to perceptions of unequal treatment
                            and grievances between the Meiteis and the hill tribes.<br><br>

                            C. Historical Factors and Land Policies:<br>
                            1. Historical factors and land policies have played a role in shaping the land ownership
                            patterns in Manipur.<br>
                            2. During the colonial era, the British implemented land redistribution policies that
                            allowed the Meiteis to acquire land in the hills, leading to concerns among the hill tribes
                            about encroachment on their ancestral lands.<br><br>

                        <li>
                            Opposition from Other Tribal Groups:<br>
                            - The demand for ST status for the Meite
                            community has faced opposition from other tribal groups in Manipur.<br>
                            - One of the reasons cited for opposition is the perceived dominance of the Meiteis, both in
                            terms of population and political representation. The Meiteis hold a majority of the
                            Assembly constituencies in the valley region.<br>
                            - Other tribal groups express concerns about the potential loss of job opportunities and
                            affirmative actions that are granted to Scheduled Tribes.<br>
                            - The advanced academic and socio-economic status of the Meitei community is also mentioned
                            as a factor contributing to the opposition.<br>
                            - Some tribal groups argue that the Meiteis already have constitutional safeguards, as their
                            language Manipuri is included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, and
                            sections of the Meitei community are classified under Scheduled Castes (SC) or Other
                            Backward Classes (OBC) categories, which provide access to reservation benefits.<br><br>

                        <li>
                            Hill Areas Committee (HAC):<br>
                            - The Hill Areas Committee (HAC) is the highest decision-making body in Manipur at the
                            legislative level, responsible for overseeing the planning, implementation, and monitoring
                            of development activities in the hill areas.<br>
                            - HAC is constituted under the Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hill Areas Committee) Order,
                            1972, and comprises all MLAs elected from the hill areas of the state.<br>
                            - It has powers related to resource management, sanitation services, primary education,
                            public health, and administrative and welfare services, including development and economic
                            planning.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Manipur High Court's Ruling:<br>
                            - The Manipur High Court directed the government to consider the inclusion of the Meitei
                            community in the ST list of Manipur.<br>
                            - The court recognized the long-standing demand and importance of the issue for the Meitei
                            community.<br>
                            - The government was instructed to submit its recommendation after considering the case of
                            the petitioners within a specified timeframe.<br><br>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                            VIII. Benefits of Inclusion in the ST List:<br>
                            - Inclusion in the ST list provides several benefits, such as post-matric scholarships,
                            overseas scholarships, national fellowships, concessional loans from the National Scheduled
                            Tribes Finance and Development Corporation, hostels for students, and reservation in
                            services and admission to educational institutions.<br><br>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Insurgency and Other Factors:<br>
                            - The insurgency in Manipur is not solely attributed to the demand for ST status by the
                            Meitei community but is influenced by multiple factors, including land disputes,
                            socio-economic disparities, and historical grievances among different ethnic groups in the
                            state.<br><br>

                            Understanding the complexities and aspirations of different communities, addressing the
                            concerns of all stakeholders, and fostering inclusive dialogue are essential for resolving
                            the insurgency and promoting peace and harmony in Manipur.<br>
