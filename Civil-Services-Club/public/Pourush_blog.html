                <h2>Q. When did you consider a career in civil services and what was your motivation for this Exam ?
                </h2>
                <p>Honestly speaking, I had no plans for pursuing myself a career in Civil Services while I was is
                    in KGP, it
                    was only in the last semester that I stumbled upon the life and essence of foreign diplomats,
                    their niceties
                    and the chance to represent the nation at international forum is something that intrigued me to
                    consider it as
                    a career option. Thus, it was after I had passed out from KGP that
                    I began planning my Civil Services preparation.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q.What are your views on taking coaching for preparation?</h2>
                <p>Being a studious student at college and having cleared JEE, boosted my morale to go for a
                    technical optional-Mathematics
                    in my case. Also, as an Engineer I have a technical footing-a luxury very few can enjoy that too
                    from an IIT. Moreover, a
                    candidate from a humanities background is bound to over score me when it comes to an optional in
                    his domain. Mathematics,
                    like other engineering optional offers no room for subjectivity at the same time it is very
                    static and hence can be scoring
                    for Engineering Graduates. The thing is even after receiving such a quality education from KGP,
                    if I do not take up an optional
                    subject in my domain, then who would. P.S.: All these are my takeaways and judgments that I
                    considered while exercising the choice
                    for choosing an optional. I do not want to encourage anyone from choosing or not choosing a
                    particular subject. At the end the call is always yours,
                    what worked for me might not work for you or so.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. Did you directly start with standard books or first read the NCERT’s and what are the main
                    aspects of current affairs one must focus on?</h2>
                <p>During the JEE days and even after coming to KGP I was mostly away from the mainstream happenings
                    around the world and subsequently lacked basic awareness in Geography, Economy, etc. Hence,
                    reading the NCERTs first provides a base on which we can build upon. Thereafter, we can move to
                    the standard sources. As for current affairs, newspaper reading is the basic prerequisite and
                    there are no two opinions for that. Initially it is a bit time consuming and requires patience
                    when you start with it. In my case, there were days when I could read newspapers and days when I
                    just couldn’t spare my time for it as I was engaged in my Job as well. In that case, I would
                    suggest one can go for these monthly magazines that coaching institutes release that contain a
                    compilation of all the recent happenings.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q.What do you think of the candidate’s attitude towards UPSC ?</h2>
                <p>I think the most important thing for a candidate is his/her mental health so a candidate should
                    not feel disheartened while preparing for the civil services examination. What I want to tell
                    other aspirants is that they should feel confident that they can do it. Even if you fail to
                    clear UPSC there are many options in life where you get many opportunities to represent the
                    country.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. Is there any advantage of being an iitian during preparation and interview?</h2>
                <p>The most important thing is you have that confidence that if you have cleared JEE you can also
                    clear UPSC otherwise as an IITian you can get a job in any other companies. The advantage of
                    being an engineer or an IITian is there are many subjects like science and technology,
                    environmental science etc where you get an upper edge over other students Where you can perform
                    better. Also taking an technical subject as a optional will assist you in your preparation In
                    interview I don’t think there is any advantage of being an IITian as there are many IITians
                    giving interviews.</p>
                <br>

                <h2> Q. What challenges did you face in your journey?</h2>
                <p>While preparing for the civil services examination the very first challenge I faced is not having
                    any friends who are also preparing for UPSC. Secondly, it is difficult to set target’s and beat
                    them. It is difficult to prepare everything alongside your job.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What value did IIT Kharagpur play in your preparation?</h2>
                <p>As a Kgpian it makes me more technically advanced which helped me in choosing my optional
                    subject. Also, it exposes me to a diverse exposure of different people and culture.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What are the mistakes to avoid during preparation ?</h2>
                <p>One mistake that I had committed while I was preparing for UPSC is that my answer writing
                    practice was not going well as it should be.Also, I would say candidates should not leave their
                    optional subject for last time preparation. The optional subject should be done before prelims
                    so that you get time for revision for your mains examination.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What type of questions were asked in the Interview?</h2>
                <p>The questions were not from the CV provided to them but rather general and covering almost all
                    topics from terrorism, encounter killings, current affairs of history to mythology, ethics,
                    politics and personal incidents as well. At last, they gave me the opportunity to express my
                    thoughts and tell them about myself.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What qualities helped you to stay motivated after IIT and Job?</h2>
                <p>The support from my family definitely played a major role. I had faith in myself and also had a
                    plan-B which propelled me and helped to maintain my mental health, plan B is quite necessary in
                    my opinion. Also, a suggestion to KGP Family of reducing your exposure to social media until
                    it’s important for future aspects.” We have set a goal which is not immediate, so have faith
                    that you will get there eventually”.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What would you suggest on keeping a job as a primary or backup option?</h2>
                <p>As the CDC Internship is in third year UPSC preparation is not that hectic, so you can try to get
                    internship as it will give you a new experience and financial freedom as well and same goes with
                    placements, if you can manage both then its well and good but take it with a pinch of salt as my
                    journey of UPSC started after KGP so I have not been through it.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What was your schedule in KGP?</h2>
                <p>I used to attend all classes even if I slept late and that also helped me in my courses as well
                    and apart from that it’s the same as yours in general case.</p>

                <h2>Q. How was your experience in College societies like Encore and TTG?</h2>
                <p>I had to juggle it sometimes, I could not give as much time and effort as I could have but I
                    think that’s how it was, I had taken too much to be balanced.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What were your marks in UPSC and also your marks in optional subjects?</h2>
                <p>My prelims marks this year was 104 and when I calculated it earlier from coaching institutes
                    answer keys it was around 112–115, so you can see how much difference is there between their
                    expected marks and actual that can give an idea that even prelims have some subjective part
                    rather than only factual knowledge. Also last year my prelims marks were 84 and 87 being the
                    cut-off. In optionals my marks were 300, 133 in first and 167 in second paper respectively.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What kept you motivated after being so close to cut-off?</h2>
                <p>I had joined a test series, I had a goal set and I wanted to improve my marks in those tests and
                    tried to improve my rank there and as such I didn’t feel too bad after the prelims </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. How much time is needed to clear UPSC?</h2>
                <p>That depends on you, people tend to clear it in their very first attempt and others in successive
                    years and also luck factor also plays a role and also I don’t know if I can give a number of
                    hours to crack UPSC.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Q. What is your advice for final year students should they go all in for their first attempt or
                    take a job and prepare along?</h2>
                <p>First few weeks of job are training periods which are not overloaded and prelims will be over by
                    time(May/June) and also if you want to prepare for Mains(probably ) exam solely you can just ask
                    them to postpone your joining if possible also you can drop the idea of job if you clear
                    prelims.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What are your views on optional subjects with less syllabus like ecology and sociology?</h2>
                <p>I
                    do believe these subjects can be finished in 6 months or so but in your second or third year you
                    have plenty of time, also math syllabus is static and you have an edge over it. I would not
                    choose them because I would not be able to compete with people having it as their majors. But if
                    you lag time ,if you think you are good at writing answers then do choose them.</p>
