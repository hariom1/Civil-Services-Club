                            The need of the hour is to show concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world. I am confident that next year when the G20 meets in the holy land of Buddha and Gandhi, we will all agree to convey a strong message of peace to the world.

                    <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 2022 Bali G20 Summit in Indonesia. As India has taken the responsibility to preside over G20, let’s have a deeper look into it. 
                        <br /-->
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><b><strong>Uniform Civil Code(UCC)</strong></b> is a proposal in India that seeks to replace
                        religious, customary, and
                        traditional personal laws governing aspects such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption,
                        and maintenance, with a single, inclusive law applicable to all individuals regardless of their
                        religion, caste, creed, sexual orientation, and gender.<br> <br>

                        It was included in <a
                            href="https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/article-44-of-the-constitution-of-india-constitutional-law-essay.php"><i>Article
                                44 </i></a>among the Directive Principles of State Policy, stating that "the
                        State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of
                        India".<i><strong> Directive Principles</strong></i> are not enforceable by the court. They
                        inform and guide the
                        government.<br> <br>

                        In this article, we have tried our best to give an overview of <strong>UCC </strong>and give an
                        unbiased opinion
                        on the matter along with some suggestions and practical problems addressing it.<br>

                    </p>


                    <h2>Historical Context:-</h2>
                    As we have surged ahead with socio-economic and technological developments in society, with thriving
                    civilization and evolving human mind, there were conflicts that arose among people and hence the
                    void of a common set of rules was felt that could bring harmony to the society. We are primarily
                    talking about the ideas that came into existence with the development of the social quotient of the
                    people. Marriage, Divorce, Inheritance, Guardianship, and Adoption are a few civil matters that
                    raised a lot of questions and confusion in India. <br><br>

                    We see different cultural systems practices and morals that prevailed across the globe at different
                    times and religion flourished as an inseparable entity along with society and played a crucial role
                    in setting up rules and regulations. There are verses in the ancient religious texts like
                    <strong>Vedas,
                        Smritis, Quran, Torah, and the Bible </strong>that primarily deal with spiritual and
                    metaphysical subjects
                    but they also contain valuable insights and guidance that can be applied to civil matters from Legal
                    Principles, Social Order, Dispute Resolution to Property rights and social welfare.<br><br>

                    After, <i>the battle of Plassey </i>(1757) and <i>the battle of Buksar</i> (1764), the East India
                    Company rose to
                    power and influenced not only the trade and revenue but also the administrative law and order of the
                    nation. Many civil matters were reformed that includes <i><strong><a

                    2019, but faced

                    and recognized religious organizations to gather their views and ideas on the matter.<br>

                            It becomes an obligation for the groom to pay the dower to the bride in the event of divorce

                                    In 1978, Shah Bano Begum was divorced by her husband. She filed a criminal suit in

                                    husband.
                                    However, this judgment faced criticism from some Muslims who argued that it
                                    contradicted
                                    Islamic law as stated in the Quran. In response to pressure and opposition from the

                            Apart from the mentioned practices, it has been observed that, traditionally, it was
                            followed that individuals who reached puberty, typically around the age of 15, were
                            considered eligible for marriage. However, this provision of Muslim Law has been
                            superseded by the Prohibition of <i><strong><a

                                        Marriage Act </a></strong></i>(2006), which establishes the legal
                            minimum age for marriage as 21 for boys and 18 for girls. While there have been notable
                            cases in different High Courts with varying interpretations of the law, the prevailing
                            legal age for marriage in India remains in accordance with the Act.<br><br>

                            Regarding polygamy, Sharia law allows Muslim men to have up to four wives simultaneously
                            under specific conditions. It should be noted that full adoption, as practiced in other
                            legal systems, is not recognized under Sharia law. Instead, Islam promotes the concept
                            of <i><strong>"Kafala,"</strong></i> which involves providing care for orphaned or abandoned children without
                            altering their legal status or lineage. In matters of inheritance, it is generally
                            observed that male heirs are entitled to a larger share compared to female heirs,
                            although this can vary based on specific circumstances and interpretations.<br><br>

                    <h2>Christian Personal Laws:-</h2>
                    <p>Christians are individuals who adhere to Christianity, a religion based on the teachings of Jesus
                        Christ. In India, there are two main categories of Christians: Catholics and Protestants.
                        Christian civil laws in India are governed by several acts, including the
                        <i><strong><a>Christian Marriage Act</a></strong></i>
                        (1872), <i><strong><a>Indian Divorce Act</a></strong></i> (1869), <i><strong><a>Indian
                                    Succession Act</a></strong></i> (1925), and <i><strong><a>Guardian and Wards
                                    Act</a></strong></i>
                        (1890). These laws were primarily formulated during the British period when people of the same
                        faith constituted the majority, fostering harmony and acceptance within the legal framework.
                        However, conflicts have arisen in various sections of the Indian Succession Act that have been
                        found to be in violation of<a><strong><i> Article 14</a></strong></i> of the Indian
                        Constitution, as highlighted in several
                        court cases.<br><br>

                                The Travancore <strong>Christian Succession Act</strong> of 1916 prevented women in the
                                Syrian Christian
                                community from inheriting property. However, the case challenged this inequality and
                                ensured
                                equal inheritance rights for Syrian Christian women in India. The Act was declared
                                invalid after
                                1951 and was subsequently superseded by the <i><strong>Indian Succession Act of

                                The petitioner, a Roman Catholic Priest, and Indian citizen, filed a petition arguing
                                that the
                                Indian Succession Act of 1925 imposed limitations on passing property for religious and
                                charitable purposes. The Judge ruled that there was no valid reason to restrict
                                individuals from
                                making testamentary dispositions of personal property for charitable causes.
                                Consequently, the
                                Supreme Court declared Section 118 of the <i><strong>Indian Succession Act</strong></i>,
                                1925 unconstitutional,
                                as it

                    India, known for its cultural diversity, is also home to Jews, who adhere to the Torah as the
                    divine commandments. While there is generally harmony with Jewish personal laws, a notable case
                    occurred in the <strong>Bombay High Court</strong> in 2012. A Jewish couple, married according to
                    Jewish customs
                    in a synagogue, filed for divorce. The couple couldn't prove their case and the court didn't

                    <h2>Hindu Law:-</h2>
                    <p>Hindu law encompasses a complex and diverse system of personal laws that govern various social
                        and moral aspects of Hindu life. It draws from a range of sources and traditions, reflecting the
                        rich cultural heritage of Hinduism. Hindu law is known for its adaptability and evolution, as it
                        adjusts to the changing needs and circumstances of Hindu society.<br><br>

                        According to Hindu law, an individual is considered Hindu if they follow the Hindu, Sikh,
                        Buddhist, or Jain religion. This definition was explicitly outlined by the Supreme Court of
                        India in the landmark case of Shastri vs Muldas. Hindu Laws comprise 5 different acts, namely
                        the <i><strong><a>Hindu Marriage Act</a></strong></i> (1955),<i><strong><a>the Hindu Succession
                                    Act</a></strong></i> (1956), <i><strong><a>the Hindu Minority and
                                    Guardianship Act</a></strong></i> (1956),<i><strong><a> the Hindu Adoptions and
                                    Maintenance Act</a></strong></i> (1956), and <i><strong><a>the Hindu
                                    Disposition of Property Act </a></strong></i>(1916).<br><br>

                        Sikh communities, however, have their own distinct personal laws that are not directly
                        influenced by Hindu law. These laws are governed by the Sikh Gurdwara Act, which specifically
                        regulates matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance within the Sikh community.<br><br>

                        The <strong>Hindu Marriage Act</strong> (1955) governs marriage and related matters among
                        Hindus. It provides
                        guidelines for solemnizing Hindu marriages, conditions for a valid marriage, rights, and
                        obligations of spouses, divorce, and restitution of conjugal rights. The <i><strong>Hindu
                                Succession Act</strong></i>
                        (1956) is aimed at providing equal rights of inheritance to male and female heirs. It addresses
                        the rules of intestate succession (when a person dies without leaving a will) among Hindus,
                        including provisions for the devolution of property, inheritance rights of sons and daughters,
                        and the rights of widows.<br>
                        The <strong><i>Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act</strong></i> (1956) deals with matters
                        related to the custody and
                        guardianship of minor children among Hindus. The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956)
                        governs the legal framework for adoption and maintenance among Hindus. It provides guidelines
                        for adoption procedures, eligibility criteria, and the rights and obligations of adoptive
                        parents and adopted children. The <strong><i>Hindu Disposition of Property Act</strong></i>
                        (1916) pertains to the
                        testamentary disposition of property by Hindus. It covers matters related to wills, gifts, and
                        the distribution of property after death.<br>
                        One of the sections of Hindu law encompasses the concept of the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF),
                        which is a legal entity comprising all direct descendants of a common ancestor, along with their
                        wives and unmarried daughters. HUF holds certain tax advantages and succession rights under
                        Hindu law. The beneficiaries of HUF can enjoy various benefits such as income tax benefits,
                        property ownership, life insurance, investments, and health insurance.<br>

                                the
                                Bombay High Court. Muldas Brudardas, the President of the Mahagujarat Dalit Association,
                                expressed his intention to visit the Swaminarayan Temple under the provisions of the
                                Bombay
                                <strong><i>Harijan Temple Entry Act</strong></i> (1947). Sastri sought an injunction to
                                prevent Harijans from
                                entering

                    <h2>North East States:-</h2>
                    <p>The northeastern region of India comprises eight states: Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur,
                        Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura. This region is home to over 288 tribes, each
                        with its unique customs and traditions. Given our focus on civil matters pertaining to all
                        Indians, it would be neglectful not to delve into the most diversified part of India. However,
                        since we haven't extensively studied every tribe, we will primarily analyze and discuss the
                        majority communities of these states.<br><br>

                        Northeast India has distinct rules and regulations that set it apart from mainland India.
                        Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Mizoram mandate an Inner Line Permit for visitors from other
                        parts of the country. Certain regions in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura have autonomous
                        district councils under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, granting them
                        legislative, executive, and financial powers. Land ownership rights are restricted for outsiders
                        in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Manipur, and parts of Assam and
                        Tripura. Special provisions in the Indian Constitution, such as Articles 371A, 371B, 371C, 371F,
                        371G, and 371H, offer specific rights, privileges, and protections to Northeastern states. The
                        region also includes protected areas that require authorization for entry, emphasizing the need
                        for preserving its unique ecological heritage.
                        The Northeastern population has shown a strong inclination towards conservatism and safeguarding
                        their land and traditions. Moreover, the region has witnessed various internal and external
                        tensions since Independence, including movements for autonomy and self-determination, border
                        disputes among states, and international conflicts. These factors have collectively hindered the
                        development of the Northeastern states, despite their abundant resources.<br>
                        Culturally, the states in the Northeast exhibit significant diversity. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam,
                        Manipur, and Sikkim follow patrilineal societal structures, while Tripura and Nagaland have
                        partial patrilineal systems. On the other hand, Meghalaya and Mizoram practice matrilineal
                        inheritance, where daughters often inherit family property. Polygamy is observed among certain
                        tribes as a means to establish influence and unity between clans or tribes, though the frequency
                        has greatly declined in the present day. Marriages are conducted according to specific tribal or
                        religious customs and traditions, either within the tribes themselves or through civil
                        ceremonies under the<a><strong><i> Special Marriage Act</a></strong></i> (1954) when families
                        oppose traditional customs.
                        Although divorce is not prevalent in most tribes of the Northeast, there are a few tribes that
                        do recognize the concept of divorce. In these tribes, the process is usually regulated and
                        overseen by a group of officials or higher elders from the families or tribes involved.<br><br>

                        In terms of inheritance and succession, the region demonstrates three main approaches.
                        Matrilineal inheritance is practiced in communities of Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura, where
                        daughters have a significant role in inheriting family property. Patrilineal inheritance,
                        prevalent in Assam, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim, generally grants greater inheritance
                        rights to sons than daughters. Several tribes and indigenous communities follow their own
                        customary laws and practices, which can vary greatly. Some communities opt for equal rights to
                        inheritance for all children. Some states have developed their own inheritance and succession
                        laws, while certain communities choose to adhere to The <a><strong><i>Hindu Succession
                                    Act</a></strong></i> (2005). Notably,
                        women in patrilineal communities may be denied property rights due to concerns that they may
                        marry individuals outside their tribe, potentially leading to the dilution of cultural
                        traditions. Adoption practices also exist, including formal adoptions and the sending of
                        children to relatives' homes for better opportunities, where they are often raised as their
                        own.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2><strong>UCC in practice:</strong></h2>
                    <p>Goa is the only state in India that has a uniform civil code regardless of religion, gender, or
                        caste. Hindus, Muslims, and Christians in Goa are all subject to the same laws on marriage,
                        divorce, and succession. When Goa became part of union territory in 1961 by virtue of the Goa
                        Daman and Diu administration act 1962 the parliament authorized the Portuguese civil code of
                        1867 to Goa and shall be amended and repealed by the competent legislature.<br><br>

                        The Goa UCC aims to promote equal distribution of wealth and income between spouses and their
                        offspring, regardless of gender. It mandates voluntary registration of all births, marriages,
                        and deaths, with provisions for divorce. Muslims registering marriages in Goa are prohibited
                        from practicing polygamy and triple talaq. Throughout a marriage, all assets and wealth are
                        jointly owned by the couple, entitling each spouse to half the property in case of divorce, or
                        the surviving spouse to half in case of death. Children cannot be completely disinherited, being
                        entitled to at least half of their parent's possessions.<br><br>

                        However, the Goa UCC exhibits several shortcomings. Catholics enjoy certain privileges, such as
                        marriage exemption registration and the ability of Catholic priests to dissolve marriages.
                        Catholics can celebrate marriages in church with a <a><strong><i>No Objection Certificate
                                    (NOC)</a></strong></i>, while others
                        only accept civil marriage registration as proof. Non-consummated marriages can be declared null
                        and void by a church tribunal for Catholics, but non-Christians must obtain a divorce through
                        courts. The law allows a specific form of polygamy for Hindus but doesn't extend the Shariat Act
                        to Muslims. Gender disparities also exist, with men being entitled to divorce for their wife's
                        affairs, while women can only obtain a divorce in certain situations, leading to clandestine
                        relationships and abandoned wives.<br><br>

                        The existence of the Uniform Civil Code within India serves as a practical example, illustrating
                        how such a law operates. While it aims for equitable practices, it does encounter challenges
                        such as inconsistencies and gender-based disparities, along with certain privileges for specific
                        religious groups. Despite these areas needing attention, the Code has contributed to social
                        harmony and continues to play a crucial role in fostering a unified society in Goa for
                        decades.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2><strong>Suggestions: </strong></h2>
                    <p>We have a range of suggestions aimed at formulating the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to address key
                        areas that uplift the nation and its citizens. These suggestions encompass crucial focal points
                        for the UCC, focusing on promoting social progress and inclusivity.<br><br>

                        The UCC should prioritize gender justice and equality in all aspects, including marriage,
                        divorce, inheritance, and property rights. Ensuring equal rights and protections for all
                        individuals, irrespective of their gender, is essential. The UCC should strike a balance between
                        promoting common civil laws and respecting cultural and religious practices that are not in
                        conflict with fundamental rights.<br><br>

                        The central government should try to involve native states in drafting their own UCCs as they
                        have a deeper understanding of the customs and cultures of the communities residing within their
                        borders. This approach allows state governments to tailor the UCCs to the specific needs and
                        sensitivities of their communities. Furthermore, the central government can gather valuable
                        insights from the state governments on the process and challenges involved in formulating the
                        law, as well as the concerns expressed by different communities.<br><br>

                        The government should actively undertake awareness campaigns to educate the public about the
                        UCC. Organizing small awareness camps, particularly in villages where diverse communities
                        coexist, can be an effective approach. These camps should involve experts or students
                        well-versed in the respective fields, who can provide information about the law, its potential
                        impacts, and the measures the government is taking to implement it. Conducting surveys in
                        various villages across India to gather public input and suggestions on effective implementation
                        that aligns with public interests is also crucial.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Implementation Challenges: </h2>
                    <p>In many rural areas of India, as well as in numerous villages and towns of the Northeast region,
                        local panchayats continue to be the preferred forums for resolving disputes, ranging from minor
                        conflicts to more serious crimes. This prevalent reliance on local panchayats, instead of the
                        formal legal system, highlights a lack of effective implementation and regulation of existing
                        laws, which undermines the well-being of citizens. This situation poses a significant challenge
                        to the successful implementation of the<a><strong><i> Uniform Civil Code (UCC)</a></strong></i>,
                        as the existing legal
                        framework faces obstacles in reaching and providing justice to all individuals in these
                        regions.<br><br>

                        Moreover, the current UCC bill has encountered opposition from various communities across India,
                        with objections rooted in religious beliefs, cultural practices, and traditional norms. Many
                        communities possess specific rights concerning civil matters as stipulated by the Constitution
                        of India, and there is concern that the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) may
                        infringe upon these rights.<br><br>

                        India is a culturally diverse country with various regional customs and traditions. Implementing
                        a uniform code that applies to all citizens may face resistance from communities that value
                        their distinct cultural practices. Balancing cultural diversity while ensuring equality and
                        justice for all can be a complex task.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conclusion: </h2>
                    <p>We have discussed the UCC starting from its origin through its current development and how
                        diverse India is legally having different provisions for various communities. Also, how daunting
                        it must be for the judiciary systems to provide just and quality judgments in a land of
                        differences. On the good side, the enforcement of UCC will help the Judiciary to give better
                        judgments on civil matters related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and maintenance
                        that challenge the fundamental rights of the nation’s citizens.<br><br>

                        Gender justice and equality, embedded in certain traditions and practices, deserve attention.
                        Lengthy court cases highlight the struggle for justice and the need for timely resolution.
                        However, there are significant implementation challenges that must be addressed, including
                        effective communication of the essence of the UCC to avoid misconceptions.<br><br>

                        The implementation of the UCC should prioritize upholding the fundamental rights of all citizens
                        and preventing discrimination against any community. It is crucial to ensure that the code
                        respects and protects the rights and interests of every individual, regardless of their
                        background.<br><br>

                        A positive update is that some states have voluntarily initiated the drafting of their own UCC
                        under their jurisdiction. Uttarakhand has already prepared its first draft, awaiting release to
                        the central government. This will provide valuable insights into the focus and objectives of the
                        UCC.<br><br>
