                    <h3>Committee report from (Various News outlets)</h3>
                    <p>The 88-page report by the present or the 22nd Law Commission of India, headed by former Karnataka High Court Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, stated that the Commission had received a reference from the Ministry of Home Affairs in March
                        2016, for a study of the usage of the <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sedition-law-explained-origin-history-legal-challenge-supreme-court-7911041/">sedition</a> law and suggest
                        amendments, if any.(the India Express)<br>

                        <strong>(Supreme Court Observer)</strong><br> The Law Commission of India released its <a href="https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Law-Commission-Report-on-Sedition.pdf">279th Report</a> which recommended retaining
                        the provision for Sedition under Section 124A of the <a href="https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2263/1/A1860-45.pdf#search=indian%20penal%20code">Indian Penal Code, 1860</a>. Section 124A describes sedition as ‘attempts
                        to excite disaffection against the Government established by law’. The provision has been widely criticized for being a tool for curbing dissent.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Reasons for Retaining </h2>
                    <p>The Report justifies retaining Section 124A on five aspects: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is necessary to protect national security from the threat of radical, anti-national, and secessionist elements. They reasoned that the growth of social media has played a role in propagating radical thoughts against India, often
                            instigated and facilitated by ‘adversarial foreign powers’.</li>
                        <li>It is a ‘reasonable restriction’ to the fundamental right of speech and expression found under Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. They reasoned that the restrictions of ‘public order’, and ‘incitement to an offense’ fall
                            within the ambit of Sedition law.</li>
                        <li>It is the ‘traditional penal mechanism’ to address the issue of terrorism. It argues that the mere presence of other counter-terrorism and security laws, such as the <a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1967-37.pdf">Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967</a>,
                            and the <a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/2022-08/ISdivII_NSAAct1980_20122018%5B1%5D.pdf">National Security Act, 1980,</a> is not a sufficient reason to abolish the sedition law. The report states that without
                            the sedition law, individuals involved in seditious activities could potentially be prosecuted under these special laws, which often carry more stringent provisions.</li>
                        <li>The Report states that ‘colonial legacy’ is not a strong enough basis for striking down the law in India’s modern democratic context. It points out that other colonial legacies like the Police Forces and All India Civil Services
                            are still retained without opposition on this ground.</li>
                        <li>The Report highlights that in countries where sedition laws have been struck down, other laws addressing seditious activities have been incorporated within their treason and counter-terrorism laws</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>National Security Acts</h2>
                    <p>This act empowers the Central Government and State Governments to detain a person to prevent him/her from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of India, the relations of India with foreign countries, the maintenance of
                        public order, or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community it is necessary so to do. The act also gives power to the governments to detain a foreigner in order to regulate his presence or expel from the
                        country. The act was passed in 1980 during the Indira Gandhi Government.[3] The interesting feature of the Rowlatt Bills was that they empowered the State to detain a citizen without giving the detainee any right to move the law
                        courts, and even the assistance of lawyers was denied to a detainee. The Jallianwalla Bagh tragedy was a direct result of the protest against these Rowlatt Bills. Article 22 of the Constitution laid down the scheme under which
                        a preventive detention law could be enacted. The PD Act 1950 was enacted and it continued to be on the statute book until the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) was enacted in 1971. The MISA was repealed in 1977. And the
                        only period in the Indian republic without any preventive detention law was the three year period, beginning with the repeal of MISA in 1977 to the promulgation of the NSA in 1980 The maximum period of detention is 12 months. The
                        order can also be made by the District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police under their respective jurisdictions, but the detention should be reported to the State Government along with the grounds on which the order has been
                        made. No such order shall remain in force for more than twelve days unless approved by the State Government. The National Security Act may also be invoked if a person assaults a policeman on duty.[2] (OP)The main point to highlight
                        with our article in this act is regarding the cases applicable which are in bold.It does not explicitly talk about sedition or Separatism.Cannot be applied to maximum cases Aborted</p>
                    <h4>Sedition cases in India.</h4>
                    <p>The first lawsuit to address the legitimacy of Section 124A was Ram Nandan vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (1958). Section 124A of the IPC, according to the Allahabad High Court, was ultra vires in character and violated Article 19(1)(a)
                        of the Constitution. The constitutional validity of Section 124-A was further challenged before a Supreme Court Constitution Bench in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962), with the argument focused primarily on the fact that
                        Section 124-A conflicted with Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled that no crime of sedition is established under Section 124-A unless the remarks, said or written, have the potential to cause disruption
                        or disturbance of public order through the use of violence, thereby overruling the decision of the Allahabad High Court. There is no offense unless the statements are likely to cause violence. Following this decision, the Supreme
                        Court ruled in 1995 in Balwant Singh And Anr vs State Of Punjab (1995) that merely raising slogans such as “Khalistan Zindabad,” “Raj Karega Khalsa,” and so on did not constitute sedition because there was no evidence or record
                        that any violence occurred despite the slogans being raised in a public place. This legal stance has been reaffirmed several times, including in the cases of Bilal Ahmed Kaloo v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1997) and Common Cause
                        v. Union of India (2018). In all of these cases, the Supreme Court instructed the courts to use caution while using sedition accusations. The courts were instructed to adhere to the principles set down in the Kedar Nath case. It
                        was reiterated that sedition charges cannot be brought just for criticizing the government or its policies
                    </p>

                    <p>Senior Advocate Colin Gonalves had petitioned before the Supreme Court of India, arguing that the Apex Court’s judgment in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962) should be reconsidered. In response, a three-judge bench of the Supreme
                        Court, consisting of Justices UU Lalit, Indira Banerjee, and KM Joseph, issued a notice in a suit seeking to declare Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code as unconstitutional and invalid. Three more petitions were marked to be
                        considered alongside Kishorechandra Wangkhemkcha’s on July 16, 2021, by a three-judge bench composed of CJI Ramana, Justice Bopanna, and Justice Roy. Retired Major General S.G. Vombatkere, Aamoda Broadcasting Company Pvt. Ltd.,
                        and Editors Guild of India, respectively, have filed challenges against Section 124A. The Editors Guild’s appeal also exposes how Section 124A is increasingly being used to intimidate journalists.</p>

                    <h3>Facts of the case</h3>
                    <p>Two journalists, namely, Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha, hailing from Manipur, and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla of Chattisgarh, have been charged with sedition over their posts and cartoons on social media sites. They have filed a writ petition
                        contesting the constitutionality of Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which criminalizes and punishes sedition. For comments and posts on Facebook, Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha had three FIRs filed against him under Section
                        124A. The remarks and postings chastised the Manipur government for handling a situation at Manipur University, referred to the Chief Minister of Manipur as an “agent of the Prime Minister,” and criticized lawmakers and their family
                        members for making anti-Schedule Tribe sentiments. Kanhaiya Lal Shukla posted cartoons on Facebook that depicted fake encounters by the police.</p>

                    <p>The points laid down in the petition</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The petitioners argue that Section 124A violates Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees an individual the right to freedom of speech and expression. Section 124A, they claim, does not impose a reasonable
                            restriction. As a result, it is exempt from the limitations on freedom of speech and expression imposed by Article 19(2).</li>
                        <li>The petition further points out that the precedent set in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962) is no longer valid. Because of the socio-economic circumstances in 1962, appropriate restrictions of the type outlined in Section
                            124A may have been warranted. Alternative laws involving safety, security, and public order have been established since then, rendering Section 124A obsolete.</li>
                        <li>The petitioners further pointed out that the provision’s ambiguity allows for arbitrary implementation and abuse. This is incompatible with the freedoms provided by Article 19(1)(a).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Wangkhemkcha’s claims, in this case, have been supported by three intervention applications. The intervenors are third parties who want to be heard by the Court in the interest of justice but do not want to become parties to the case.
                        They are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mr Sashi Kumar, a distinguished journalist, is the first intervenor, arguing that the ambiguous language of Section 124A has been misapplied to label criticism against the administration as sedition. He claims that the goal of
                            the sedition statute was not to penalize dissent, citing the Constituent Assembly and early Parliamentary Debates.</li>
                        <li>The second intervenor, legal professor Dr Sanjay Jain, provided an overview of sedition legislation in different nations to assist the Court in analyzing the statute in light of current events. He claims that since Section 124A
                            was created by a colonial authority to suppress anti-colonial activities, it has to be revisited.</li>
                        <li>The Foundation for Media Professionals, the third intervenor, raises similar arguments concerning the provision’s pre-constitutional character.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Supreme Court will decide if Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, which criminalizes sedition, is unconstitutional, hence the matter is pending before the Apex Court.</p>

                    <h3>JNU CASE</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The JNU sloganeering case relates to a 2016 "poetry session" to commemorate the third anniversary of the hanging of 2001 Parliament attack case convict Afzal Guru. Anti-India slogans were apparently shouted during the event. Delhi
                            Police booked the JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, along with other student leaders, among them Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, for sedition under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code.</li>
                        <li>Four days after the event JNU’S student union president Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested by the Delhi police and charged with sedition.Two other students were arrested soon afterwards, including Umar Khalid . The arrests drew heavy
                            criticism from many sections of society, on the grounds that the BJP government was attempting to silence political dissent. Thousands of students, faculty, and staff protested the arrest at JNU, and classes at the university
                            were stopped for several days.</li>
                        <li>Investigations into the incident were carried out by the Delhi government and the university administration. Both found that the controversial slogans had been shouted by outsiders to the university. The arrested students were
                            all granted bail, with the judge noting in one case that there was some evidence of the accused shouting slogans.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Patiala House court incidents</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kanhaiya Kumar's hearing was scheduled to take place on 15 February, in the Patiala House court. A group of 40 lawyers began shouting slogans against JNU prior to the hearing.The journalists covering the case were assaulted by
                            the lawyers outside the Patiala House court. Students and teachers of JNU who had come to attend the hearing were also beaten by a group of men in lawyer robes, who tried to push them out of the courthouse.</li>
                        <li>On 17 February, a second hearing was held in the Patiala House court: this too was disrupted by men wearing lawyer robes. Following this scuffle, Kanhaiya Kumar's judicial custody was extended until 2 March.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Supreme Court rulings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On 16 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a plea seeking "free and fair access to justice" to Kanhaiya Kumar, following the acts of violence against journalists, JNU students and lecturers Two days later on
                            18 February, Kumar filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking bail On the same day, a six-member panel that had been investigating the Patiala House court violence submitted its report to the Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court-appointed
                            panel stated that the policemen present at the Court were responsible for the security lapses, and further stating that police allowed 2 persons to enter the courtroom, and continued to let the assault take place, in direct
                            violation of the SC direction on Kanhaiya's safety The Supreme Court transferred Kumar's bail plea to the Delhi High Court to ensure his safety.</li>
                        <li>Kanhaiya Kumar was granted six months interim bail by the Delhi High court on 2 March 2016. Justice Pratibha Rani noted that there were no recordings of Kumar participating in anti-national slogans. Going beyond the immediate issue,
                            the judge also held that the alleged slogans threatened national integrity, and could not be protected as free speech. She characterized them as a form of "infection," which could sometimes be treated, but occasionally needed
                            to be amputated.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>PUBLIC SAFETY ACT(Act No. VI of 1978)</h2>
                    <h3>LEGAL HISTORY-</h3>
                    <p>The Public Safety Act has its roots in the Defence of India Act of 1915, passed during British rule,This was replaced in 1954 with a temporary Preventive Detention Act by the Jammu and Kashmir government, which was again ratified in
                        1958 followed by numerous amendments leading to the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Ordinance in 1977. This was then amended into the 1978 Public Safety Act enacted by Sheikh Abdullah. The 1978 PSA was amended in 1987, 1990, 2012,
                        and as recently as August 2018 to allow individuals to be detained outside the state.</p>

                    <h3>LEGAL DEFINITION-</h3>
                    <p><i>  “An Act whereas it is necessary in the interest of the security of the State and public order to make law providing for the measures hereinafter appearing. ”</i></p>
                    <p>KEY POINTS-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PSA applies only to Jammu and Kashmir, it is very similar to the National Security Act that is used by the central and other state governments of India for preventive detention</li>
                        <li>It was introduced by the then-Chief Minister, Sheikh Abdullah, in 1978 to ostensibly stop the smuggling of timber. However, the political motives behind the law became clearer when Sheikh Abdullah used it for the first time against
                            political rivals.</li>
                        <li>Following the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, PSA was one of the state laws which was retained under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019.
                        </li>
                        <li>In 2015, the government made public the figure of 16,329 persons having been detained under the act since 1988, nearly all from Kashmir</li>
                        <li>The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978 is only one of the acts in India that cater to prevention detention at a state level.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>LEGAL PROVISIONS UNDER PSA-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detention without trial: The PSA allows for the preventive detention of individuals without the need for a formal trial. It grants the government the authority to detain a person for up to two years without a trial or formal charges
                            being filed against them.</li>
                        <li>Grounds for detention: These include activities that are deemed prejudicial to the security of the state, maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and essential services.</li>
                        <li>Administrative detention: The detention orders under the PSA are issued by the District Magistrate or Divisional Commissioner, who acts as the "detaining authority." The detained person can be held in custody for a specified period
                            as deemed necessary by the authorities.</li>
                        <li>Review boards: The law mandates the establishment of advisory boards to periodically review the cases of detained individuals. These boards assess the validity and necessity of the detention orders and provide recommendations to
                            the government.</li>
                        <li>Limited judicial oversight: The PSA allows for limited judicial review of detention orders. The detained person can make a representation against their detention before an Advisory Board, and the Board's recommendations are then
                            sent to the government for consideration.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>PROCEDURE-</p>
                    <p>Public Safety Act allows administrative detention of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 months - 1 year, where "any person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order".</li>
                        <li>6 months - 2 years, in the "case of persons acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State"</li>
                        <li>12 months, in the case of the persons indulging in smuggling of timber.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Issuing order</h3>
                    <p>Under Section 8 of the act, a Divisional Commissioner or a District Magistrate, both executive authorities, may issue a detention order to prevent anyone from acting in a manner prejudicial to the "security of the State or the maintenance
                        of the public order"</p>
                    <h3>Informing grounds of detention</h3>
                    <p>However sub-section 2, allows the authority to hold back any information that it considers "against the public interest to disclose"</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the authority is required to inform the State Government about the order and get it approved in 12 days, for the order to remain in force.</p>
                    <p>Reviewing the orderUnder Section 13 of the act, the detaining authority is required to inform the person detained, the grounds of detention within 10 days of detention in a language they understand</p>
                    <p>All detention orders, along with the grounds of the orders and representations (if any) must be placed before a non-judicial advisory board within 4 weeks of the detention. The advisory board is then required to review the detention
                        order, representation and any information necessary and submit its report to the State Government within 8 weeks of the detention. However, the person detained is not entitled to any legal counsel, since PSA explicitly bars detainees
                        from being represented by legal counsel before the advisory board.</p>

                    <h3>Compensation</h3>
                    <p>Further, Section 22 of the act, provides immunity to the officials involved, providing a complete bar on legal proceedings against any officials for anything done or intended to be done in good faith in pursuance of the provisions
                        of this Act.</p>
                    <h3>CRITICISM-</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>According to a Human Rights Watch report in 1990: "the act establishes a legal procedure which, while technically consistent with international standards, in practice falls short of international due process and fair trial standards"</li>
                        <li>In February 2020, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court of India by Bhim Singh of Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party terming PSA "as dead and ultra vires</li>
                        <li>Data from an RTI revealed that between April 2016 and December 2017, 99.40% or 998 cases were found to be suitable for detention by the advisory board; however, in the same time period, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court annulled
                            the detention orders in 81% of the admitted 941 cases</li>
                        <li>During a preventive detention case under PSA in 1982, the Supreme Court of India said: "danger looms large that the normal criminal trials and criminal courts set up for administering justice will be substituted by detention laws
                            often described as lawless law"4</li>
                        <li>Role of Detaining Authorities-An order of administrative detention under the PSA can be passed by the District Magistrates and Divisional Commissioners, thus making it a purely executive exercise of power.</li>
                        <li>Role of Advisory Boards-Since the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and
                            determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The advisory board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the advisory board.</li>
                        <li> The Advisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government. Prior to the Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018] the members of the advisory board were appointed by the
                            Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.The ordinance removes the mandatory requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court. Now the members – provided they were not sitting
                            judges – would be appointed by the government on the recommendations of a 3-person committee made up of senior state bureaucrats.
                        </li>
                        <li>Anyone detained under PSA is not entitled to legal counsel. The board is known for almost always upholding the detention orders passed by executive officials. For example, an RTI application] filed by two students of the Department
                            of Law, University of Kashmir revealed that the advisory board was referred 1004 detention orders by the State Government between April 2016 and mid-December and it found sufficient cause to uphold the detention order in 99.40%
                            cases.The J&K High Court quashed more than 81% of the detention orders that the Board upheld earlier in the same period. The RTI also revealed that the advisory board spent more than 75% of its total expenditure in 2016–17
                            to uphold detention orders which were quashed later on by the court. It was observed by Amnesty International was informed that in many cases, detainees refuse to file representations before the advisory board, as they see
                            no hope of a proper hearing
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES ACT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Act gives special procedures to handle terrorist activities, among other things. It aims at the effective prevention of unlawful activities associations in India. Unlawful activity refers to any action taken by an individual
                            or association intended to disrupt the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India</li>
                        <li>UAPA(Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) has the death penalty and life imprisonment as the highest punishments
                        </li>
                        <li>Under UAPA, both Indian and foreign nationals can be charged</li>
                        <li>Approval for property seizure by National Investigation Agency (NIA): As per the Act, an investigating officer is required to obtain the prior approval of the Director-General of Police to seize properties that may be connected
                            with terrorism.</li>
                        <li>Insertion to the schedule of treaties: The Act defines terrorist acts to include acts committed within the scope of any of the treaties listed in a schedule to the Act. The Schedule lists nine treaties, consisting of the Convention
                            for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings (1997), and the Convention against Taking of Hostages (1979). The Bill adds another treaty to this list namely, the International Convention for Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism
                            (2005).</li>
                        <li>The objective of the proposed amendments is to facilitate speedy investigation and prosecution of terrorist offenses and designating an individual as a terrorist in line with international practices. </li>
                        <li>Amendment to Schedule 4 of the Act, the NIA will be allowed to designate an individual suspected to have terror links as a terrorist. In the current scenario, before the amendment was made, only organizations were designated as
                            ‘terrorist organizations’. </li>
                        <li>At present, Section 25 of the UAPA states that forfeiture of property acquired from terrorism can be done only with the prior approval given in writing by the DGPs of the state wherein lies such property. But the problem is that
                            many times, the terror accused owns properties in multiple states. In this kind of a scenario, it becomes tough to get the approvals of several DGPs and can cause a delay in the whole process of forfeiting property, which can

                        <li>The Act assigns absolute power to the central government, by way of which if the Centre deems an activity as unlawful then it may, by way of an Official Gazette, declare it so. </li>
                        <li>The opposition voiced concerns about the amendments, saying the provisions were against the federal structure of the country enshrined in the Constitution of India.
                        </li>
                        <li>There was no pre-legislative consultation.</li>
                        <li>Designating an individual as a terrorist raises serious constitutional questions and has the potential for misuse</li>
                        <li>An individual cannot be called a ‘terrorist’ prior to conviction in a court of law, It subverts the principle of “innocent until proven guilty. A wrongful designation will cause irreparable damage to a person’s reputation, career
                            and livelihood</li>

                    <h4>PREFACE-</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>South africa has almost same political situation as india yet their sedition law are considered far better and mature than india’s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>LESSONS-</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Narrow Definition: South Africa's sedition laws have a narrower definition, focusing on acts that promote violence, public disorder, or hostility against the state. This ensures that legitimate political dissent and criticism are
                            not unjustly categorized as sedition.</li>
                        <li>Intent Requirement: South Africa's sedition laws require clear evidence of intent to incite violence or promote public disorder. This ensures that individuals are not penalized for unintentional or ambiguous expressions.</li>
                        <li>Protection of Fundamental Rights: South Africa's sedition laws are designed to strike a balance between protecting national security and upholding fundamental rights, including freedom of speech and expression.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>GHANA-</h3>
                    <h4>LESSONS-</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus on Violence and Public Disorder: Ghana's sedition laws primarily target acts that promote violence, public disorder, or hostility against the state. This ensures that the law specifically addresses actions that pose a threat
                            to public safety and stability.
                        </li>
                        <li>Contextual Considerations: Ghanaian courts have emphasized the importance of considering the context and intent behind alleged seditious acts when determining guilt. This helps ensure a fair and nuanced application of the law.</li>
                        <li>Proportionality in Penalties: Ghana's sedition laws provide for proportional penalties, taking into account the seriousness of the offense and the potential harm caused.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>CANADA-</h3>

                    <h4>LESSONS-</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clarity in Offenses: Canada's sedition laws clearly define the offenses related to incitement to violence or promoting hatred. This clarity helps prevent ambiguity and allows for a more focused application of the law.
                        </li>
                        <li>Proportional Application: Canadian courts have emphasized the importance of proportionality in applying sedition laws, considering the context, intent, and potential harm caused by the speech or expression in question.</li>
                        <li>Canada has a notable provision in its sedition laws that require the consent of the Attorney General for initiating sedition proceedings. This requirement adds an additional layer of oversight and ensures that sedition charges
                            are brought forward with proper consideration and legal scrutiny.

                    <h4>LESSONS-</h4>
                    <strong>Shift to Address Terrorism and Violent Extremism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 2007, New Zealand repealed its sedition laws and replaced them with legislation focused on addressing terrorism and violent extremismt.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 and the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Act 2008 now provide the legal framework for combating terrorism-related activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Definition of Terrorism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Zealand's laws define terrorism as acts intended to cause significant harm to people, property, or society for ideological, political, or religious purposes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Preventive Measures:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Zealand's laws include provisions for preventive measures, such as monitoring and investigating individuals or groups suspected of engaging in terrorist activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>These measures aim to proactively identify and address potential threats to national security.</li>

                    <strong>Judicial Oversight and Review:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>India can incorporate provisions for judicial oversight and review of security measures to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected.
                        </li>
                        <li>This would provide a system of checks and balances, preventing potential abuses of power and safeguarding individual liberties.</li>

                    <h4>LESSONS-</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sweden has a provision in its sedition laws that allows for increased punishment based on the status of the person involved. This means that if a person in a position of power or influence engages in seditious activities, they
                            may face more severe penalties compared to an ordinary citizen.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS-</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Narrowing the Scope:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Like countries such as Canada and Germany, India can consider narrowing the scope of its sedition law to focus on acts that directly incite violence or pose a genuine threat to national security(Countries like Germany, despite
                                having strong public restrictive laws, don’t come under the radar of human right watch dogs is mainly because they don’t use the word ‘sedition’ to describe the offense. The committee report also highlights that such countries
                                have different laws to arrest such activities, India can consider narrowing ‘sedition’ and making other laws(UAPA,NSA..) more powerful this also mitigates the criticism that ‘sedition’ is taken from a colonial mindset )</li>
                            <li>This would help prevent the misuse of sedition charges against individuals engaged in peaceful political activities or expressing dissenting opinions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Contextual Considerations:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>India can draw from the examples of Finland and Sweden, where courts consider the context, intent, and potential harm caused by alleged seditious acts when determining guilt.</li>
                            <li>Incorporating contextual considerations would ensure a fair and balanced application of the law, preventing arbitrary interpretations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>High Threshold for Prosecution:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Following the example of Norway, India can establish a higher threshold for prosecuting individuals under sedition laws.</li>
                            <li>India can also follow sweden law on more stricter prosecution for public figures.</li>
                            <li>Requiring clear evidence of direct incitement to violence or clear threats to public safety would provide greater protection for freedom of expression while still addressing genuine threats.(This is actually considered in court
                                trial in India)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Safeguarding Freedom of Expression:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taking inspiration from countries like Canada, India can introduce provisions that explicitly protect freedom of expression within the sedition law itself.</li>
                            <li>This would help strike a balance between safeguarding national security and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Review and Oversight:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing a mechanism for review and oversight of sedition cases, similar to the requirement of the Attorney General's consent in Canada, can help ensure proper scrutiny and minimize the potential for misuse of sedition
                                charges.</li>
                            <li>More focus on prevention on such incidents and minimizing their circulation like China’s.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Provisions of the National Security Act 1980</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NSA empowers the Centre or a State government to detain a person so that he does not act in any manner prejudicial(harmful) to national security. The person need not be charged during the period of detention.</li>
                        <li>An individual can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months.
                        </li>
                        <li>The detained person can be held for 10 days without being told the charges against him.</li>
                        <strong>Grounds of Detention</strong>
                        <li>Acting in any manner prejudicial to the defense of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India .</li>
                        <li>Regulating the continued presence of any foreigner in India or making arrangements for his expulsion from India.</li>
                        <strong>Constitution of Advisory Board</strong>
                        <li>The central or state government shall constitute one or more Advisory Boards.</li>
                        <li>It consists of three persons who are qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High Court.</li>
                        <li>The grounds of detention must be placed before the Advisory Board within 3 weeks from the date of detention.</li>
                        <li>The detained person can appeal before the Advisory Board but they are not allowed a lawyer during the trial.</li>
                        <li>If the Advisory Board finds no sufficient cause for the detention, the government shall revoke the detention order and release the person.</li>
                        <strong> Loopholes of the National Security Act</strong>
                        <li>The arrested person cannot be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a lawyer of his choice.</li>
                        <li>The arrested person should be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours</li>
                        <li>While it is true that the Constitution provides for Article 22 (3) that does not extend safeguards of the criminal system to preventive detention, the justification for persisting with the same provisions even 70 years after independence
                            needs to be reviewed.</li>
                        <li>Since the NSA allows custody of people without framing a charge, it has become a convenient tool for the government and police to circumvent the formalities of the Criminal Procedure Code and the courts of the land.</li>
                        <li>The police make use of the NSA when they are unwilling or unable to make a criminal case. Instances of journalists critical of the establishment being charged with NSA are becoming common.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are no separate figures currently available for detentions under the NSA. The 177th Law Commission Report of 2001 reveals that 14,57,779 persons were arrested under preventive provisions in India. It is important to review the
                        continued usage of the NSA and to close the loopholes that permit law enforcement to abuse constitutional and statutory rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>Preventive detention must not be used for regular law and order issues.</p>
                    <h4>UPA</h4>
                    <p>Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) that violates the Constitutional guarantees of citizens’ fundamental rights. Though this law has been in existence in India’s statute books for over five decades, the harsh amendments it
                        has gone through in recent years has made it draconian, repressive, and amenable to gross misuse at the hands of ruling politicians and the police. Typical of such misuse are the cases of the three anti-CAA student protestors –
                        Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha – who were arrested under UAPA without any valid grounds .</p>
                    <p>On 9 March 2021, the Union Minister of State for Home, Shri G. Kishan Reddy, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, admitted to the uncommon overuse of the UAPA. He confirmed that 1948 persons were arrested under the UAPA in 1226 cases
                        across the country in 2019, which showed a 72% increase as compared to 2015. The following figures will show the increase in cases and arrests between 2015 and 2019: <br> 2015: 897 cases with 1128 arrests <br> 2016: 922 cases with
                        999 arrests <br> 2017: 901 cases with 1554 arrests <br> 2018: 1182 cases with 1421 arrests <br> 2019: 1226 cases with 1948 arrests <br> 2019 saw the highest number of arrests in the country, particularly in the states of Uttar
                        Pradesh (498) Manipur (386), Tamil Nadu (308), Jammu & Kashmir (227) and Jharkhand (202). <br> Despite the large number of arrests under the UAPA, the number of prosecutions and convictions shows a steep decline. The Government
                        of India has admitted that a mere 2.2% of the cases registered between 2016 and 2019 resulted in conviction. We may conclude that the vast majority of the arrests under UAPA were made on spacious grounds just to spread fear and
                        muzzle dissent. <br> However, the Government of India seriously departed from the principles of criminal jurisprudence and from the provisions of the Constitution when the UAPA (Amendment) Act, 2008 was codified after the 26/11
                        Mumbai terror attack. This was done during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. Successive UPA and NDA Union governments which have been or are in power are responsible for the extreme stringency of the
                        UAPA.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2008, the UPA government made bail provisions much more stringent, increased the pre-charge detention period from 90 days to 180 days and, most damagingly, placed the burden of proof on the accused. In 2019, the NDA government further
                        amended the UAPA to allow individuals, not merely organizations, to be designated terrorists. This amendment also gave unfettered and autocratic powers to the executive, in particular the National Investigation Agency (NIA), to
                        enter any State and arrest any person. Though some voices of protest were raised when these amendments were made, most political parties supported the move. For the UPA members or any other party to act outraged now is, therefore,
                        disingenuous.</p>
                    <p>The most shocking of the arrests under the UAPA have been of persons accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case. Several well regarded activists who have fought throughout their lives for the rights of tribal people and other oppressed groups
                        have been arrested as terrorists and, even today, languish in jail. . The names of those arrested are well known – Sudha Bhardwaj, Rona Wilson, Gautam Navlakha, Anand Teltumbde, Arun Ferreira and Varavara Rao, to name a few. And,
                        of course, Father Stan Swamy – an 84 year old Jesuit priest – suffering from Parkinson’s and other ailments, who was not granted bail despite repeated requests and eventually died while in custody.</p>
                    <p>Former judge of the Patna High Court, Justice Anjana Prakash, is on record stating that 66% of the total number of persons booked under the UAPA were for conspiracy without any allegations of accompanying acts of violence. She also
                        revealed that out of the total number of 386 cases being investigated by the NIA, 74 cases were for non-UAPA offenses while 312 pertained to UAPA offenses. She added that the NIA has not been able to submit charge-sheets in 56%
                        of these cases, meaning that the accused in these cases still remain in custody. These figures definitely point to an unhealthy practice of “governance by fear” which has no legitimate place in a democracy.</p>
                    <p>The law, as it stands today, has many flaws and loopholes making it amenable to large-scale abuse and misuse by some politicians and overzealous policemen. Participating in a session at the G-7 Summit in Cornwall, United Kingdom, held
                        between 11 and 13 June 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of democracy and freedom being part of the Indian ethos. If the Prime Minister is true to his word, his government should heed the call of legal luminaries and the
                        ordinary public, appreciate that the UAPA in its present form poses a serious threat to the freedom of our citizens and to democracy and, after consulting legal experts and taking into account the views of Parliament, enact fresh
                        legislation to replace the UAPA which, while addressing concerns regarding terrorism, safeguards the right to liberty of those exercising their fundamental right of free expression as guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution
                        of India.

                    <h3>PSU</h3>
                    <p>Detention Without Trial: The PSA allows for the detention of a person without a formal charge and without trial. <br> It can be slapped on a person already in police custody; on someone immediately after being granted bail by a court.
                        <br> Unlike in normal circumstances, a person who is detained under the PSA need not be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the detention. <br> No Right to File Bail Application: The detained person does not have the
                        right to move a bail application before the court, and cannot engage any lawyer to represent him or her the detaining authority. <br> Discretionary powers: The District Magistrate who has passed the detention order has protection
                        under the Act, which states that the order is considered “done in good faith”.
