                        <p>
                            In the fast-paced world of governance and public administration, civil servants play a
                            pivotal role in shaping policies, implementing reforms, and ensuring efficient service
                            delivery to citizens. We were fortunate to have with us one such civil servant, Miss Anju
                            Joon (HSS, 21), IIT Kharagpur to share with us her experiences and preparation journey for
                            UPSC Civil Services examination. To motivate and inspire aspiring civil servants, a recent
                            seminar conducted by the Civil Services Club provided a unique opportunity to the students
                            to virtually meet Miss Anju Joon who shared her personal preparation journey and offer
                            valuable insights into the UPSC examination process. The seminar not only provided a
                            platform for interaction and learning but also fostered a sense of community among the
                            aspirants, encouraging them to strive for excellence and stay committed to their dreams of
                            serving the nation through civil services.

                            The need of the hour is to show concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world. I am confident that next year when the G20 meets in the holy land of Buddha and Gandhi, we will all agree to convey a strong message of peace to the world.

                    <h2>Q. What inspired you for UPSC and how has been your experience so far?</h2>
                    <p>Until my final year, I had no plans for civil services or appearing for the UPSC exam. The major
                        turning point in my life that made me go for civil services was the migrant crisis during the
                        covid lockdown. It sparked a thought that a prudent administrative judgment might have better
                        dealt with the situation and made me realize what my true calling is. Till my final semester I
                        had mentally prepared myself for UPSC and hence did not apply for the placements at CDC, despite
                        this I did appear for a walk-in interview and was lucky enough to get shortlisted.



                    </p>

                    <h2>Q. Should one start reading NCERT’s or the standard books at the beginning?</h2>
                    <p>There is an element of subjectivity here, as for in my case I did not read any of the NCERT’s
                        other than Geography for class 12, owing to time constraints. This somewhat worked for me, but
                        might not work for you. If you have the leisure to read then you should go through them. Also
                        after talking to many candidates who were selected this year, I got to know that NCERTs of
                        history are quite important and one should try to cover those.</p>

                    <h2>Q. Are monthly magazines sufficient for prelims or should they supplement it with Newspapers?
                    </h2>
                    <p>For the prelims, I did not read the newspapers or the monthly magazines. It was after my mains,
                        that is during my interview I began reading newspapers. The approach for monthly magazines
                        shouldn’t be like reading it for the whole month at a stretch, instead one should read
                        newspapers daily and at the end take up these magazines for revision purposes. For current
                        affairs, I mostly followed news analysis from the internet and made my notes from there itself
                        on a daily basis.</p>

                    <h2>Q. How should one include current affairs in GS-answers and optional?</h2>
                    <p>With Everyone nearly putting the same output as far as the main crux of the answers are
                        concerned, adding the recent happenings about the same can make you stand out of the crowd. Also
                        you can supplement the same with a plausible opinion or a solution (if any). Again, if you are
                        running short of time you may consider omitting current affairs from your answer.</p>
                    <h2>Q. How should one analyze mock tests and PYQ’s?</h2>
                    <p>The effort one puts in the exam only counts if maneuvered in the correct direction. There are
                        topics of vast diversity in the exam, with some topics demanding mugging up of facts while
                        others requiring a subtle understanding and some both. It is only after analyzing mock papers,
                        pyq’s and following the trend will one be able to get an understanding of how to study and
                        attempt the paper.</p>
                    <h2>Q. Does an interview require specific preparation or going with a free mind is beneficial?</h2>
                    <p>I think both, for the interview you should be exhaustively prepared about yourself, your Detailed
                        Application Form (DAF) as well as you should have a free approach to juggle out of any situation
                        placed against you during the interview. You should be very much ready with details like your
                        background, if you’ve done any internship or Job then questions from there might be placed
                        before you. Also it is very essential to be honest with your answers and attention must be given
                        to framing of answers and your response to them.</p>
                    <h2>Q. What aspects should be fulfilled while making notes separately for mains and prelims?</h2>
                    <p>I haven’t been preparing separate notes for prelims and mains, but made sure to make notes on
                        important topics/current affairs which i found crucial, until prelims. I just added extra
                        information, if any, for repetitive news rather than re-writing everything as the content in
                        newspapers is often monotonous. After clearing prelims I made short notes beforehand related to
                        value adding topics for e.g indexes, that could be read shortly before exams, because those
                        thick books won’t be helpful in the eleventh hour.</p>
                    <h2>Q. How should one add value adding materials to the notes apart from newspapers and books?</h2>
                    <p>I realized that once you start preparing, then you automatically comprehend what value adding
                        material can be. While reading books and newspapers, you will start to realize what extra key
                        points should be researched up on as value adding points. One shouldn’t worry too much about
                        that</p>
                    <h2>Q. Do you suggest any sequential order for the GS syllabus?</h2>
                    <p>I personally started with disaster management, international relations, history and so on. Some
                        subjects do not require a foretaste of other subjects and can be read separately, like
                        economics, history, disaster management, so I started with them. While some subjects do require
                        some knowledge of other subjects, reading them in sequential order would be recommended, like
                        doing international relations after polity. Some topics are smaller and can be viewed later too.
                        It is purely based on one’s interest and comfort for subjects.</p>
                    <h1>Q. How should one prepare for essay writing? What was your strategy?</h1>
                    <p>I was unprepared for my essay writing until prelims and started to prepare 10–15 days before my
                        actual essay writing exam, which I highly regret and do not recommend. It is a very good subject
                        as it is very scoring. Due to time constraint I had to go through mocks and essays from previous
                        years toppers like Shubham Kumar sir, and tried to mold my essays based on that analysis. When I
                        used to come across crucial events, morals, ideas or value adding key points during regular
                        reading of books, novels, biographies, I just tried to include those points in my essays. so
                        it’s just mindful reading that has helped me more.</p>
